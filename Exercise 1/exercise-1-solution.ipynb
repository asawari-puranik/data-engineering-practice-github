    "1. You will need to pull the filename from the download uri.\n",
    "1. The files are `zip` files that will also need to be unzipped into their `csv` format.\n",
    "1. They should be downloaded into a folder called `downloads` which does not exist currently inside the `Exercise-1` folder. You should use `Python` to create the directory, do not do it manually."
