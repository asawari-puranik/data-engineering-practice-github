# Exercise #1 - Downloading files with Python
### Problem Statement
1. You need to download files that are sitting at the specified `HTTP` urls. You will use the `Python` package `requests` to do this work.
1. You will need to pull the filename from the download uri.
1. The files are `zip` files that will also need to be unzipped into their `csv` format.
1. They should be downloaded into a folder called `downloads` which does not exist currently inside the `Exercise-1` folder. You should use `Python` to create the directory, do not do it manually.
